Samba is an attempt to implement an Active Directory compatible Domain \
Controller. \
\
This is a static image/template for CBSD that provides a Samba-based share in RW(!) mode \
that is accessible without authentication ! \
This can be useful for obtaining the SMB/CIFS resource as quickly as possible. \
\
If you want a full managed Samba service, please use the samba4 image/template. \
\
Usage: \
\
 \\${ip4_addr}\
\
or:\
\
  smb://${ip4_addr}\
